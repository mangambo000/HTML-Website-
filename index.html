<p> Soccer is by far my most favorite sport to play, it is constantly filled with intensity, excitment, and most of all......fun.
<p> this is my favorite soccer player, his name is Neymar Junior and he plays for the team Paris Saint German, also known as PSG. I like him because he is very skill full and brings a new element to the game that know one else brings. He makes the game exciting</p>
